This is Ishan the creator of the Ishketch™ NFT collection.

Ishketch™ NFT collection was a group of artwork that made by mix media in the traditional art form.
I will be releasing 3 categories in Ishketch™ NFT Collection.


1st is the "IshKetch" the common art which is the sketch art using graphite pencil


2nd is the "IshInk" the higher value than the common art, artwork that used or made by inks.


3rd and Last will be the "IshPaint" the rare art NFT from my collection because I also have a rare time to do paintings.
